This is the Syncthing project which pursues the following goals:

 1. Define a protocol for synchronization of a folder between a number of
    collaborating devices. This protocol should be well defined, unambiguous,
    easily understood, free to use, efficient, secure and language neutral.
    This is called the [Block Exchange Protocol][1].

 2. Provide the reference implementation to demonstrate the usability of
    said protocol. This is the `syncthing` utility. We hope that
    alternative, compatible implementations of the protocol will arise.

The two are evolving together; the protocol is not to be considered
stable until Syncthing 1.0 is released, at which point it is locked down
for incompatible changes.

## Getting Started

Take a look at the [getting started guide][2].

There are a few examples for keeping Syncthing running in the background
on your system in [the etc directory][3]. There are also several [GUI
implementations][11] for Windows, Mac and Linux.

## Vote on features/bugs

We'd like to encourage you to [vote][12] on issues that matter to you.
This helps the team understand what are the biggest pain points for our users, and could potentially influence what is being worked on next.

## Getting in Touch

The first and best point of contact is the [Forum][8]. There is also an IRC
channel, `#syncthing` on [freenode][4] (with a [web client][9]), for talking
directly to developers and users. If you've found something that is clearly a
bug, feel free to report it in the [GitHub issue tracker][10].

## Building

Building Syncthing from source is easy, and there's a [guide][5]
that describes it for both Unix and Windows systems.

## Signed Releases

As of v0.10.15 and onwards release binaries are GPG signed with the key
D26E6ED000654A3E, available from https://syncthing.net/security.html and
most key servers.

There is also a built in automatic upgrade mechanism (disabled in some
distribution channels) which uses a compiled in ECDSA signature. Mac OS
X binaries are also properly code signed.
